Our application is not allowed to manage the database and other server-related activities. It is the duty of the API to do these tasks on the behalf of the application. API acts as a middleman between our application and the server. "

A child is never allowed to operate a microwave and other similar things which can be dangerous for him so a child is asked to inform any elder if he needs to operate the microwave. The elder is the middleman operating between the microwave and the child. "

So thatâ€™s why it is not allowed to directly access the server API acts as a middleman. But if API is working as a middleman it will not do the same. It will only allow to perform the limited task for which it is commanded.

The above things can be explained by again taking the example of a child. if a child persists to buy the whole ice cream shop then his father will never do this. he will try to convince the child by just eating single ice cream. "

We use libraries which contain the predefined code and we have to just import the libraries to perform some tasks.

Library is a collection of code itself. But API is a collection of useful techniques or functions. API consists of libraries.API can be made of several libraries to complete an action. A single library in itself is not an API."
